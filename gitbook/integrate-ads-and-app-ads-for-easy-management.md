# Integrate Ads & APP Ads For Easy Management

We have built a easy to use UI for adding / updating ads.txt from UI for product & Adops teams. Its a one time integration where domain/ads.txt and domain/app-ads.txt needs to be linked to our URL. Everytime when a new entry is added we publish the same in our URL and hence website needs to pick from this published url of adster once a day or once in 2-3 days.&#x20;

Product / Ops: From app.adster.tech, navigate to "Managed Ads TXT" section, add your domain name like "https://adster.tech" and we will fetch the existing file. And then you can make the entries, and save the same to generate a URL. \

E.g. URL: https://storage.googleapis.com/public-assets-adstxtmanage/Citymall main website-app-ads.txt from where ads.txt needs to be read and updated in the domain
